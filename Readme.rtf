The "Trip Easy" project aims to develop a cutting-edge web application that simplifies the process of finding and booking accommodations. Key features include user registration, property listings, favorites lists, a rating system, host account management, and a reservation system. The goal is to provide a seamless and secure experience for travelers and hosts, redefining the accommodation booking landscape. The system is built using React for the frontend, Node.js and Express for the backend, and MongoDB as the database.
